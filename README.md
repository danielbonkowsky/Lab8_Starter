## How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
> Graceful degradation is when we start with max technology and hopefully 
address lower levels with grace. 

In terms of service workers, max technology means an endpoint with a good 
network connection—we design our application to work with a user who has good 
connection. The lower levels would be an endpoint that has poor or no 
connection. Our application may function worse, but by using service workers we 
address that lower level with grace—even a user with no connection will be able 
to access the information on our app.
